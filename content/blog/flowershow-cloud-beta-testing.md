Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹!

Weâ€™re super excited to share that the public launch of Flowershow Cloud is just around the corner, and we need your help to make it even better!

If you have some markdown files â€” or even better, an Obsidian vault â€” you can try out publishing them with Flowershow Cloud. Give our platform a spin and let us know if you encounter any bugs or have any feedback. It literally takes **2-5 minutes** to get started!

Weâ€™ve set up a WhatsApp group where you can easily share your discoveries, ask questions, and chat with us. All the testing instructions will be available in the group description. Your input is essential in helping us polish Flowershow Cloud for everyone, and weâ€™re truly grateful for your support.

Ready to dive in? Sign up [here](https://tally.so/r/3EN1yX) to get early access to the platform and our WhatsApp group!

Thanks for being awesome ðŸ˜Ž,

The Flowershow Team
