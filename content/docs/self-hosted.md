## What is Flowershow Self-Hosted?

Flowershow Self-Hosted is a template for easily converting your markdown files into an elegant website. It's built on a standard, modern web stack â€“ **React**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind** and shipped with a basic **default theme** to get you started with just a few clicks.

Flowershow supports **CommonMark** and **GitHub Flavored Markdown**, but also many **Obsidian-specific syntax elements**, like internal links or footnotes[^1].
[^1]: Support for some GFM and Obsidian-specific syntax elements is still a work in progress. See our [[roadmap]] to learn more.
