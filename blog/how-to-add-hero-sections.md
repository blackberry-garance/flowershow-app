Flowershow now allows to set hero sections transform your page headers into elegant, full-width banners. Let's explore how to enable them!

## What is a Hero Section?

A hero section is a prominent area at the top of a page that typically includes:
- A compelling title
- A descriptive subtitle
- Call-to-action buttons
- A featured image

Let's walk through how to create this on your own site!

## Creating Your First Hero Section

Start by adding a basic hero section to a single page:

1. Open your markdown file
2. Add the following to your frontmatter:

```yaml
---
showHero: true
title: Welcome to my blog!
description: Join me as I explore the world, code, and the little things in life that make it wonderful.
---
```

Here's how it looks with just these basic elements:

## Adding Call-to-Action Buttons

Make your hero more interactive by adding call-to-action (CTA) buttons:

```yaml
---
cta:
  - href: #featured-posts
    label: Featured posts
  - href: /about
    label: About me
---
```

See how the buttons appear in the layout:

## Adding a Featured Image

Now, let's enhance visual appeal with a featured image:

```yaml
---
image: /hero.png
---
```

Full hero configuration example on a single page:

```yaml
---
showHero: true
title: Welcome to my blog!
description: Join me as I explore the world, code, and the little things in life that make it wonderful.
image: /hero.png
cta:
  - href: /about
    label: About me
  - href: /featured
    label: Featured posts
---
```

## Enabling Heroes Site-Wide

Want heroes on all your pages? Add this to your `config.json`:

```json
{
  "showHero": true,
  "title": "Welcome to my site!",
  "description": "A collection of interesting thoughts and ideas",
  "image": "/assets/hero.jpg",
  "cta": [
    {
      "href": "/about",
      "label": "About"
    },
    {
      "href": "/docs",
      "label": "Docs"
    }
  ]
}
```

This sets default hero content for all pages. You can still customize heros on individual pages with frontmatter.

## Customizing Individual Pages

Even with site-wide heroes enabled, you can customize specific pages:

1. Override the default content:
```yaml
---
title: Custom Page
description: This page has its own hero content
image: /assets/custom-hero.jpg
---
```

2. Or disable the hero completely:
```yaml
---
showHero: false
---
```

## Best Practices

Follow these tips for the best results:

1. **Images:**
   - Use high-quality images
   - Optimize them for web (reduce file size)
   - Test how they look on different screen sizes

2. **Content:**
   - Keep titles clear and compelling
   - Write concise descriptions
   - Ensure all links work correctly

## Troubleshooting

If your hero isn't appearing:

1. Check your frontmatter syntax - ensure it's properly formatted
2. Verify image paths start with `/assets/`
3. Confirm `showHero` is set to `true`
4. Check browser console for any errors
