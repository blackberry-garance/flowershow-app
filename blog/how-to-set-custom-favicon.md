A favicon is a small icon that appears in your browser's address bar, tabs, and bookmarks. It helps users identify your site quickly and adds a professional touch to your web presence. Premium Flowershow sites can now set custom favicons.

## Setting up your favicon

1. First, prepare your favicon file. Common formats include .`ico`, `.png`, and `.svg`. Make sure your icon is square and at least 16x16 pixels (32x32 or 64x64 are recommended for better quality).

2. Add your favicon file to your site's repository. For example, you might place it at `/assets/favicon.ico`.

3. Configure your favicon in your [[config-file|`config.json` file]] by adding the `favicon` field:

```json
{
  "favicon": "/assets/favicon.ico"
}
```

That's it! After your next deployment, your custom favicon will appear in browser tabs and bookmarks.

## Tips for creating a good favicon

- Keep it simple - favicons are small, so complex designs won't be visible
- Ensure good contrast - your icon should be recognizable even at small sizes
- Test different sizes - your favicon should look good both in browser tabs and bookmarks
- Consider using .ico format for best browser compatibility
