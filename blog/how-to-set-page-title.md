## The Three Ways to Set Page Titles

Flowershow offers three methods to set your page titles, listed here in order of precedence (highest to lowest):

### 1. Title Frontmatter Field (Highest Precedence)

The most explicit and reliable way to set your page title is using the `title` field in your markdown frontmatter. This method takes the highest precedence and will always override other title sources.

```markdown
---
title: Complete Guide to Markdown Syntax
---

Content in file named "markdown-syntax-guide.md"
```

**Result:**
- Page title will be "Complete Guide to Markdown Syntax"
- URL path will be: `/markdown-syntax-guide`

**When to use:** Use this method when you want precise control over your page title, especially when it differs from your main heading or filename.

### 2. First Level 1 Markdown Heading

If no `title` frontmatter is specified, Flowershow will use the first level 1 heading it finds in your markdown content as the page title.

```markdown
# Complete Guide to Markdown Syntax

Content in file named "markdown-syntax-guide.md"
```

**Result:**
- Page title will be "Complete Guide to Markdown Syntax"
- URL path will be: `/markdown-syntax-guide`

**When to use:** This is perfect for content where your main level 1 heading naturally serves as the page title.

### 3. File Name (Fallback)

When neither a frontmatter title nor a level 1 heading is present, Flowershow will use the filename (without the `.md` extension) as the page title.

```markdown
Content in file named "markdown-syntax-guide.md"
```

**Result:**
- Page title will be "markdown-syntax-guide"
- URL path will be: `/markdown-syntax-guide`

**When to use:** This works well for when you prefer descriptive filenames (especially popular in Obsidian note-taking) and minimal frontmatter, or when you simply forget to set the title for your page.

>[!hint]
> Notice how in this method file name is both a base for the rendered page URL path and for it's title.
> 
> If you prefer this option, you can use more descriptive names for your files, e.g. have a file named `Complete Guide to Markdown Syntax.md`. In this case the title of that page will be "Complete Guide to Markdown Syntax" and the URL path will be `/Complete+Guide+to+Markdown+Syntax`.

### SEO Implications

Page titles aren't just for display on your pageâ€”they're crucial for SEO as they appear in search results, browser tabs, and social shares, and help search engines understand your content.

Here are the key SEO considerations for page titles:
- Include relevant keywords in your titles
- Keep titles under 60 characters for optimal search results
- Make titles unique across your site

```yaml
# Good
title: "Complete Guide to Setting Up Docker Containers"

# Avoid
title: "Setup Guide"
```

## Conclusion

Understanding Flowershow's title precedence system gives you the flexibility to organize your content exactly how you want. Whether you prefer explicit frontmatter control, natural heading-based titles, or simple filename fallbacks, you can choose the approach that best fits your workflow and content strategy.

The key is consistency - pick the method that works best for your site's structure and stick with it across similar content types.
