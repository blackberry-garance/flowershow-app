We're excited to announce that full text search is now available for all premium Flowershow sites. Powered by Typesense and InstantSearch, this feature lets your readers quickly find content across your entire site.

## Features

- Search across all site content
- Fast, real-time search results as users type
- Typo-tolerant search that finds content even with misspelled terms

## How to Enable

1. Go to your Floweshow dashboard
2. Open your premium site settings
3. Enable full text search

After enabling the feature, please allow a few minutes for your site's content to be initially indexed.

## Content Updates

Your search index automatically stays in sync with your content:
- Initial indexing takes a few minutes after enabling the feature
- Any future content updates are indexed during your regular site syncs
- No manual intervention needed - just sync your site as usual
