# Best blog solutions for Obsidian users

## Cloud

**Need:** I'm authoring my blog in Obsidian. What are the best hosted (cloud) platforms where I could publish my blog? I want to keep authoring in Obsidian.

### Obsidian Publish

- **Workflow**: click “Publish” from any note (or a folder) inside Obsidian and your site is live.
- **Hosting & price**: $8 / month per site when billed annually, includes CDN, search, custom domain, and theme tweaks.  ￼
- **Pros**: minutes to set up, no build pipeline, Obsidian page links and graph just work.
- **Cons**: limited theming/extensibility compared with full static-site stacks; no plugins, and only basic analytics.


### Ghost(Pro) + Obsidian plugin

- **How it works**: Obsidian "Send to Ghost" plugin lets you push a note straight to your Ghost site via its Admin API.  ￼
- **Hosting & price**: Ghost(Pro) starts at $9 / month for fully managed hosting with CDN, email newsletter, memberships, Stripe integration, backups, and security.  ￼
- **When to choose**: you want a business-ready publishing stack (paywalls, tiers, analytics) but prefer writing in Obsidian instead of Ghost’s editor.
- **Pros**: Managed “everything-in-one” stack—blog, newsletter, paid memberships, Stripe—so you can monetise and control branding without self-hosting.
- **Cons**: Starts at $9/month and scales with audience; custom themes require developer effort.

### HashNode (Pro)

- **How it works**: enable Hashnode’s “Publish articles from GitHub”. Every markdown file pushed to a chosen repo is auto-published (or updated) on your Hashnode blog; front-matter controls title, tags, draft state, etc. Use the free Obsidian Git community plugin to sync your vault (or just a /blog folder) to GitHub on save or on demand.
- **Hosting & price**: Hashnode gives you comments, reactions, built-in newsletter, custom domain, and a dev-centric audience.
- **Pros**: 
- **Cons**: Publishin from GitHub is only available



## Self-hosted
