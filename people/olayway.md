Ola is a front-end developer with a keen eye for details and aesthetics. She strives for excellence and thrives on challenges. She's also an optimist who can turn any adversity into an opportunity. When not coding she spends her free time with her nose in a book or down some rabbit hole learning. She also has a "thing" for flowers.
