You can customize the appearance of your Flowershow Cloud site by adding a `custom.css` file to your site's repository.

## Creating the File

1. Create a new file named `custom.css` in the root of your repository (or the root directory of you're site's content if you're publishing from a subfolder)
2. Add your CSS rules to customize colors, fonts, layouts, and more
3. Commit and sync your site to apply the changes

> [!important]
> When using h1 tags in custom components, you must set `display: block !important;` in your CSS due to how page titles are handled internally.
