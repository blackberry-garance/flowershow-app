# Custom 404 Page

In Flowershow, you have the flexibility to create custom 404 pages for handling broken pages or links.

To create a custom 404 page, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `content` folder in your project.

2. Create a new file named `404.md` within the `content` folder.

3. Customize the content of the `404.md` file to create your desired 404 page. You can use HTML or Markdown syntax to structure and style your page.

### Example:

```markdown
# 404

<h1>Page Not Found</h1>

<p>Sorry, the page you are looking for does not exist. Please check the URL or navigate back to the home page.</p>
```
