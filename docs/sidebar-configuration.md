Flowershow allows you to enable a sidebar navigation that displays your site's structure and links to all pages.

## Enabling the Sidebar

To enable the sidebar navigation, add the `showSidebar` property to your `config.json` file in the root of your repository:

```json
{
  "showSidebar": true
}
```

The sidebar will automatically generate the navigation structure based on your content directory structure.
