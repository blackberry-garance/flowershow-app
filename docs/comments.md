## Default behavior and customization

By default, comments will be enabled on all pages. You have two ways to customize this behavior:

### Hide comments on specific pages

To hide comments on a single page, add `showComments: false` to the page's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Page Without Comments Section
showComments: false
---
```

### Show comments only on specific pages

If you prefer to enable comments only on specific pages, you can:

1. Hide comments site-wide by setting `showComments: false` in your site's [[config-file|config file]]:

```json
{
  "showComments": false  // Disable comments site-wide (if you want to enable them only on specific pages)
}
```

2. Enable comments on specific pages by setting `showComments: true` in their frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: My Page With Comments Section
showComments: true
---
```
